My summary about Connecting Mobile Devices 

USB is used for a variety of purposes, and it stands for Universal Serial Bus. It enables high-speed wired communication. It's used for charging and data transfers. Another type of USB is called Micro USB—it's smaller and is pretty common, like a drone I had used it on. There is an older USB type that was used, but it was bigger than Micro USB. Now, newer phones use USB-C, and it is also used on some laptops and computers instead of USB. USB-C can transmit different signals like DisplayPort, HDMI, and Thunderbolt. If you are using an Apple device, you are using a Lightning connection. Some advantages over Micro USB are that it gives higher power output for phones and tablets, and it can be inserted either way—like, it can be turned upside down, and it will still work because it's the same shape on both sides. Way before USB, we used serial interfaces. It's like those blue or other colored things that have 9 pinhole things and you screw into a thing. It's either called a DB-9 or DE-9, and it commonly transports RS-232 signals. It's been an industry standard since 1969. Another type of communication is NFC—it's Near Field Communication. You can send small amounts of data wirelessly, and it's built into your phone. There is also Bluetooth—it connects over short distances. Lots of things use Bluetooth. Another type is hotspot—your phone or device becomes your own personal wireless router that others can connect to.
